## THIS IS SPARK CASUAL GAME ENGINE 
I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE ASSETS , EVERYTHING IS MADE BY ARTIFLEX MUNDI.DECOMPILED FROM THEIR GAMES

## CUB format 
All of the games made in this engine have the files encoded in a format named CUB , <ins>Data.cub</ins> and <ins>Game.cub</ins>.
To decode I used an BMS script I found online , it worked for me for an older game and a newer one
